# Experiment 1

This folder contains scripts to reproduce results on the first experiment. The scope of this 
experiment is posteriors, biases, and calibration on toy ellipticities in the low noise setting. 

The convergence tests are in the form of unit tests for this experiment in `test_convergence.py`

## Scripts

* `get_posteriors.sh`: Get 1000 shear posteriors using the slurm script.
* `get_figures_shear.sh`: Obtain all relevant diagnostic plots and save to `figs` folder.
